## Rationale <a name="Rationale"></a>

The [Berlin Open Science meetup community](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Open-Science-Meetup/) has now been active for around 5 years and has almost XXX members. A number of informal ‘open science communities’ are now springing up all around Europe and the rest of the world.

In order to take this to the next level, and demonstrate leadership in this space, we propose transforming the informal meetup group into a formal society, or [Verein](https://www.tbd.community/en/a/how-to-found-verein-charity-germany ) -  a legal form of charitable organisation based in Germany. 

Our proposal for this is the development of the *Open Science Academy*.

This would help to legitimise the community, and give more recognition to open research practices. The primary expected outcome is the more structured growth of the community by providing a more comfortable and legal structure to be part of.
