## Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>

The [Berlin Open Science Meetup community](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Open-Science-Meetup/) has now been active for around 5 years and has almost XXX members. A number of informal ‘open science communities’ are now springing up all around Europe and the rest of the world. Most of these remain informal groups, associated with research institutes,

In order to take this to the next level, and demonstrate leadership in this space, we propose transforming the informal meetup group into a formal society, or [Verein](https://www.tbd.community/en/a/how-to-found-verein-charity-germany) -  a legal form of charitable organisation based in Germany. 

Our proposal for this is the development of the *Open Science Academy*.

This would help to legitimise the community, and give more recognition to open research practices. The primary expected outcome is the more structured growth of the community by providing a more comfortable and legal structure to be part of.

## Mission statement <a name="#mission"></a>

The OSA is a resurgence of the [Society for Free Science](https://www.nature.com/articles/154048a0), established in 1940 but now long since gone. We follow a revised version of their 5 core propositions:

1. Increase of knowledge by scientific research and its diffusion have a primary human value; 
2. science can only flourish in an atmosphere of freedom; 
3. Scientific life should be autonomous; 
4. Conditions of research appointments should give workers freedom to choose their own problems; 
5. scientific people in countries not under dictatorial rule should co-operate to maintain freedom of research.

### Principles, virtues, and values that we follow and uphold:

Integrity - 

Freedom - 

Accountability - 

Honesty - 

Truth - 

Justice - 

Tolerance - 

Patience - 

Forgiveness -

## Code of Conduct <a name="#coc"></a>

Our Code of Conduct is simple. We expect the highest ethical and moral standards for both research and all other aspects of life. We do not impose personal rules of conduct on any individual, save those that we expect within a well-functioning, mature society. These are our guidelines:

* We follow the rule of the law, and believe this is sufficient for our CoC.
* In general, we expect people to behave like well-socialised and mature adults within this community.
* We believe that this includes talking to each other should an incident occur as a first means of conflict resolution.
* Only if the above fails, will the founding members of the OSA intervene. Resolution to ensure that we can all co-exist peacefully together will always be our priority.
* Any issues that arise that break the law should be reported to the relevant authorities following traditional procedures.
