# Orga
The organizational tasks and files - initial Repo.

1. Read to get the idea what we want to do, we drafted everything in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10CtLgUbECX17-_1693AAqrnuuVSVrDnkhJ-GeHFuBPY/edit?usp=sharing). 

2. There is also a [Slack channel](https://openscienceacademy.slack.com/) for discussion - newcomers welcome 

3. Right now you are ready to contribute. Our current tasks are groped in Github projects as standard Kanban boards. If you are taking care of a task - move it to "currently doing" and assign it to yourself. Moving a card to "Done" column is addictivly satisfying - [try it yourself! :)](https://github.com/open-science-academy/Orga/projects/1)
