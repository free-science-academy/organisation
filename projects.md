## Projects

The whole point of the FSA is to combine pragmatism with ideology, principles with practices. We practice what we preach. We see this in two ways. Firstly, to demonstrate that we, as a society, are actually doing things to progress freedom in science. Seondly, for our members and those associated with us to be able to pragmatically receive credit for devoting part of their time to us.

These are the core projects within the FSA. Each of them are completely open for anyone to contribute to:

* Open Science Skills training for researchers
*	Finding Oriented Research (Nanopublications)
*	[Foundations for Open Scholarship Strategy Development](https://open-scholarship-strategy.github.io/site/)
*	Strategy dev for open universities in transitional regions (post-conflict) (JT: not sure where this came from)
* Open Scholarship Consultancy (note: IGDORE and A2P can be used here)
* We are the primary maintainers for the [Open Science subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Open_Science/)
* Free Science videocast/webcast/podcast and webinar series

### More detailed descriptions and information for each

1. Open Science skills training

The simple goal here is to educate people properly about how to do science.

2. Founding Oriented Research

Project in development

3. [Foundations for Open Scholarship Strategy Development](https://open-scholarship-strategy.github.io/site/)

This document aims to agree on a broad, international strategy for the implementation of open scholarship that meets the needs of different national and regional communities but works globally.

4. OPen Scholarship Consultancy


5. Open Science subreddit

This subreddit collates the latest from the world of "open science"", including but not limited to open access, open data, open education, open peer review, and open source.

6. Free Science vidcast


7. Scholarly Communication super-collection


8. Open Research Glossary


### Potential future project ideas

* A meta-review on the status of misconduct in science

* Patterns of 'open practices' across different research areas

* Who suffers most from existing power structures in academia

* Investigating the links between Open Source and Open Science
