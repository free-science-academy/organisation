Our Code of Conduct is simple. We expect the highest ethical and moral standards for both research and all other aspects of life. We do not impose personal rules of practical conduct on any individual, save those that we expect within a well-functioning, mature society. 

These are our guidelines, and they apply to all offline and online events and spaces regarding the FSA:

* We follow the rule of the law, and believe this is sufficient for our CoC.

* In general, we expect people to behave like well-socialised and mature adults within this community.

* We believe that this includes talking to each other should an incident occur as a first means of conflict resolution.

* Only if the above fails, will the founding members of the FSA intervene. Resolution to ensure that we can all co-exist peacefully together will always be our priority.

* Any issues that arise that break the law should be reported to the relevant authorities following traditional procedures. The FSA will help with any such procedures if needed.


### Principles, virtues, and values that we follow and uphold

As part of our Code, these are just some of the values that we uphold and act by, and expect others to too:

**Integrity** - We pledge to uphold the highest degrees of ethical and moral conduct, both as researchers and humans.

**Freedom** - We act, and expect others to act, without constraints, except for those imposed by our own moral standards and beliefs.

**Accountability** - We accept full responsibility for our actions and behaviours.

**Honesty** - We never intentionally deceive or mislead others.

**Truth** - We always strive to ascertain the truth, no matter the situation.

**Justice** - To follow the function of the law and human rights, and encode them in our beliefs and practices.

**Tolerance** - We are accepting of all individuals, no matter what their views or backgrounds are.

**Patience** - To operate at a pace in which all members of the community can contribute in their capacities.

**Forgiveness** - Any transgression can be forgiven.

**Courage** - We stand up for what we believe in.
