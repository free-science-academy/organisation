## Membership

Proposal: â‚¬20/year membership, flat universal rate

Fee waivers: No questions asked upon request

Benefits: 

Our hope with this membership scheme is to help provide a sense of identity and commitment for researchers, as well as any other interested groups. We set a highly inclusive standard from the beginning that transcends typical academic or institutional barriers. Through this institutionalisation, it is our hope to raise the status and credibility of 'open science' and 'free science'.

It is our experience that creation of communities like this can lead to wonderful things by bringing people together. Be it writing code together, launching new projects, or writing research papers, magical things happen when brilliant people come together from different backgrounds.
