### Founding members

The FSA is the brainchild of Wojciech Francuzik and Jon Tennant. The remaining 5 founding members were hand-selected based on people we know and trust to uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity that we embed into the FSA.

The founding members include:

* Wojciech Francuzik - Resident in dermatology at the Deprtment of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, Charite. His research focuses on anaphylaxis, human skin microbiome and host-microbial interactions, as well as atopic dermatitis. Additionally, he is conducting reserach on Negative Pressure Wound Therapy. He is a member of Professor’s Margitta Worm’s Workgroup where he is conducting clinical as well as lab bench research.

* Jon Tennant - Palaeontologist.

* AK - 

* PG - 

* PM - 

* IG - 

* ET - 

We note that each of the founding members are from Europe. This is simply because this is where we each grew up, and who we have adopted as friends and close colleagues during our time working on 'open science'. The founding members represent a close group of individuals that we know are strong together, and can collaborate with trust and make this project succeed.
