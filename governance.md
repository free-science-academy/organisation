## Governance structure

The governance structure of the OSA comprises the seven initial founding members. Each of these has an equal share and voting right.

There are three major operating levels.

1. The founding members
2. The core "nucleus" members, comprising invited experts
3. The regular "cloud" membership, who each have an equal voting right

The full control of the OSA is within the regular membership. They have the right to define the structure of the 'upper' two levels.

### Responsibilities

Each of the three groups have their own responsibilities, that overlap to a certain extent with the other groups.

1. Founders:

2. Nucleus:

3. Cloud:
