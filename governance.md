## Governance structure

The governance structure of the FSA comprises the seven initial founding members. Each of these members has an equal share and voting right within the organisation. We also have a shared liability for associated risks.

There are three major operating levels.

1. The founding members
2. The core "nucleus" members, comprising invited experts
3. The regular "cloud" membership, who each have an equal voting right

The full control of the OSA is within the regular "cloud" membership. They have the right to define the structure of the 'upper' two levels. To reflect this, they will have full voting rights on all critical elements of the operation of the FSA.

### Founding members

The FSA is the brainchild of Wojciech Francuzik and Jon Tennant. The remaining 5 founding members were hand-selected based on people we know and trust to uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity that we embed into the FSA.

The founding members include:

* Wojciech Francuzik - Resident in dermatology at the Deprtment of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, Charite. His research focuses on anaphylaxis, human skin microbiome and host-microbial interactions, as well as atopic dermatitis. Additionally, he is conducting reserach on Negative Pressure Wound Therapy. He is a member of Professor’s Margitta Worm’s Workgroup where he is conducting clinical as well as lab bench research.
* Jon Tennant - Palaeontologist.
* AK - 
* PG - 
* PM - 
* IG - 
* ET - 

We note that each of the founding members are from Europe. This is simply because this is where we each grew up, and who we have adopted as friends and close colleagues during our time working on 'open science'. The founding members represent a close group of individuals that we know are strong together, and can collaborate with trust and make this project succeed.

### Responsibilities

Each of the three groups have their own responsibilities, that overlap to a certain extent with the other groups.

1. Founders: Administration of the project.

2. Nucleus: To demonstrate what we stand for, by associating our reputation with specific individuals, and their values and work.

3. Cloud: To make free science normative around the world.


### Taskforces

Within the main structure of the OSA, each of the founding members is assigned to be the Head of a different taskforce. Each of these is autonomous under the FSA.

These are the taskforces and their associated Heads:

* Reproducible Research - Anna Krystalli

* Metaresearch - Peter Grabitz

* Open Science skills training - Jon Tennant

* Democratising knowledge - 

* Open Access publishing - 

* Community management and communication - 

* Innovative dissemination - Wojciech
