## Governance structure

The governance structure of the FSA comprises the seven initial founding members. Each of these members has an equal share and voting right within the organisation. We also have a shared liability for associated risks.

There are three major operating levels.

1. The founding members
2. The core "nucleus" members, comprising invited experts
3. The regular "cloud" membership, who each have an equal voting right

The full control of the OSA is within the regular "cloud" membership. They have the right to define the structure of the 'upper' two levels. To reflect this, they will have full voting rights on all critical elements of the operation of the FSA.

### Responsibilities

Each of the three groups have their own responsibilities, that overlap to a certain extent with the other groups.

1. Founders:

2. Nucleus:

3. Cloud:


### Taskforces

Within the main structure of the OSA, each of the founding members is assigned to be the Head of a different taskforce. Each of these is autonomous under the FSA.

These are the taskforces and their associated Heads:

* Reproducible Research - Anna Krystalli

* Metaresearch - Peter Grabitz

* Open Science skills training - Jon Tennant

* Democratising knowledge - 

* Open Access publishing - 

* Community management and communication - 

* Innovative dissemination - Wojciech
