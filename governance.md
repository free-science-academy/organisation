The governance structure of the FSA comprises the seven initial founding members. Each of these members has an equal share and voting right within the organisation. We also have a shared liability for associated risks.

There are three major operating levels.

1. The founding members
2. The core "Nucleus" members, comprising invited experts
3. The regular "Cloud" membership, who each have an equal voting right

The full control of the OSA is within the regular "cloud" membership. They have the right to define the structure of the 'upper' two levels. To reflect this, they will have full voting rights on all critical elements of the operation of the FSA.

### Roles of founding members

* Technical Officer: To manage and support the daily technical operations of the FSA.
* Advocacy Officer: To co-ordinate and support the public and political advocacy of the FSA and its members.
* Integrity Officer: To make sure that the FSA conducts itself with absolute integrity.
* Financial Officer: To assist with the [Funding Strategy](funding.md) of the FSA.
* Community Officer: To support the development of the FSA community.
* Communications Officer: To implement the [Communications Strategy](communications.md) for the FSA
* Taskforce Officer: To manage and support the various [Projects](projects.md) for the FSA.

### Responsibilities

Each of the three groups have their own responsibilities, that overlap to a certain extent with the other groups.

1. Founders: Administration of the project.

2. Nucleus: To demonstrate what we stand for, by associating our reputation with specific individuals, and their values and work.

3. Cloud: To make free science normative around the world.
