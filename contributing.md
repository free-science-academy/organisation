Right now you are ready to contribute. Our current tasks are grouped in Github projects as standard Kanban boards. If you are taking care of a task - move it to "currently doing" and assign it to yourself. Moving a card to "Done" column is addictively satisfying - [try it yourself! :)](https://github.com/open-science-academy/Orga/projects/1) 


# Contribution Guidelines
These are the main contributing guidelines for the development of this project.

Feedback and contributions of any form are welcomed. Feel free also to [contact us](mailto:) to discuss anything further.


## Reporting issues

- **Search for existing issues.** Please check to see if someone else has reported the same issue.
- **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, browser and version. Also, include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Project Setup
Refer to the [README](README.md).

## Content style
This is flexible to each module as required, and defined by each development team in advance as part of the protocol.

## Code style
Flexible, as long as it is consistent. Ideally, all content would be drafted in markdown, for increasing re-use. This can be easily performed in R Studio, for example, which also has a GitHub interface to make collaborating on this project even simpler.

Please read [this guide](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) to familiarise yourself with this process. Which in itself, is actually fairly powerful for Open Science!

## Pull requests

Please refer to each project's style guidelines and guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

- Fork the repo on GitHub
- Clone the project to your own machine
- Commit changes to your own branch
- Push your work back up to your fork
- Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!


- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes â€“ keep them simple and small. If possible, squash your commits.
- Try to share how your code has been tested before submitting a pull request.
- If your PR resolves an issue, include **closes #ISSUE_NUMBER** in your commit message (or a [synonym](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages)).
- Review
    - If your PR is ready for review, another contributor will be assigned to review your PR
    - The reviewer will accept or comment on the PR.
    - If needed address the comments left by the reviewer. Once you're ready to continue the review, ping the reviewer in a comment.
    - Once accepted your code will be merged to `master`
